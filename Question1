A constructor is a special method in object-oriented programming languages that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is typically called when an object is created or instantiated. The purpose of a constructor is to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its member variables or properties.
Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to and can be overloaded, meaning a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This allows for flexibility in creating objects with different initial configurations.
