Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on defining essential characteristics and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and understandable components. The purpose of abstraction is to provide a clear and concise representation of entities, allowing developers to focus on the essential aspects and ignore irrelevant implementation details.
